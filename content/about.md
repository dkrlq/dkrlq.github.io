First off, why I named this blog 'Sajber' is kind of a tribute to a former TV-show that was broadcasted in the late 90's @ SVT in Sweden.

The content of the blog will mainly focus on Cybersecurity, but will (probably) occasionally also feature other tech-stuff.

This blog is a tool for me to spread knowledge and possibly to rant about stupid cybersecurity-stuff.
